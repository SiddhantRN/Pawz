This app is made to make both the rescuing of animals and adoption
of rescued animals easier.It can be used by both rescue centers and
normal people. Normal people/pet enthusiasts can use this app to see
the animals nearby that are there for adoption,put an animal for
adoption which they rescued, donate for the cause(to the nearby
rescue centers),people will be able to donate both in terms of money
or in terms of supplies needed by these rescue centers.One of the
main feature will be that if anyone comes across any animal in
medical need then they'll be able to alert about it which the nearby
rescue centers will be able to see and then help that animal.
The PetInfo section will have all the necessary information needed
for owning and raising a pet like their training ,medical needs,
proper diets etc.
Rescue centers will be able to use this app
to put animals up for adoptions, see the alerts about the animals in
need and accept donations by other people.
